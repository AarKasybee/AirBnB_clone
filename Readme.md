3. Performing operations on objects e.g. count, compute stats, etc...
4. Updating attributes of an object

Tasks
- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the
initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances

- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file

- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel

- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.

- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
